# Realtime Image Classification with TensorFlow and OpenCV
This script takes realtime image feed from the webcam and hence classify the image as per as the trained class.
The model used has 4 class i.e up, down, left, right (in the form of arrow)

!Disclaimer: Jupyter notebook is required to run the scripts. Tensorflow2.x and CV2 (OpenCV)
 Use anaconda to get better performance
 
 > conda install tensorflow==2.0
 
 > conda install opencv
